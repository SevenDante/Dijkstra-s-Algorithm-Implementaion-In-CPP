# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-Implementaion-In-CPP
Dijkstra's algorithm implementation using STL C++. It saves your time to much extent & is very useful during competitive programmimg. If 
you look at actual code with structure & compare it with stl version you'll be amazed to see how easy it's with Standard template library.
